**PROJECT TITLE:** Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration:
               A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

**PROBLOEM STATEMENT:** The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

**Required skills:** Github Cloning,Python,Pandas,MySQL,mysql-connector-python,Streamlit, and Plotly.

**OVERVIEW:** I used streamlit to design a GUI that has the features I've listed below.
1.It contains four menus with the names home, search ,insights, and about.
2.In basic insights,you can view the data's fundamental insights, such as the most frequent transactions and least frequent transactions.
3.In search,you can search by transaction type,district,top-transactions and registered user.
4.finally you can see the details about the app in about section.

**WORK FLOW:**
**step1:** Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
clone it..

**step2:** Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.

**step3:** Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
retrieval.

**step4:** Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

**step5:** Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.

**step6:** Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different
facts and figures to display on the dashboard.
